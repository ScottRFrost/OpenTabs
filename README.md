# OpenTabs
A Google Chrome extension that lets you create groups of tabs, save them across multiple devices, and reopen them later.

## Latest Version: 1.0 The Beginning.
This is Open Tabs first version. It includes 5 simple actions the user can take:
- **Create** and name a group containing all the tabs in the current window.
- **Open** a new window containing all the tabs of an existing group.
- **Add** the current tab to an existing group.
- **Update** the tabs in an existing group with all the tabs in the current window.
- **Delete** an existing group.

As for the user interface, the window consists only of a button to add groups, a list to display all existent groups and two links, **About** and **Help**, which lead to Open Tabs' website. Finally, the capability to sync across devices but also work as expected when offline has been implemented.

**Note:** If you want to see information on previous versions of Open Tabs, you can find it [here](https:/OpenTabs.io/updates.html).

## Files and Folders not Included in this Repository
Because some files contain sensitive information such as as SSH keys, API keys, PIN numbers, such files have been excluded from this repository. In this case, such files are:
- The **fonts** folder: Open Tabs uses a font called **Visby CF** which is not free and I am therefore not allowed to provide the files. It is, however, a beautiful font and you can purchase it [here](https://creativemarket.com/connary/184499-Visby-CF-%E2%80%93-Geometric-Sans-Font).
